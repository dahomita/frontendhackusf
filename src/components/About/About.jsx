            <p>
              FallGuardian is dedicated to enhancing the safety, health, and
              well-being of elderly residents in nursing homes through
              innovative AI-powered monitoring and companionship solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that every senior deserves to live with dignity,
              security, and meaningful connections to others, regardless of
              their physical limitations or living situation.

            <p>
              Falls are the leading cause of injury and injury death among
              people 65 and older. Many seniors live alone with limited social
              connections, and current emergency response systems often require
              manual activation, which isn't possible if someone is unconscious
              or severely injured after a fall.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond physical safety, social isolation and loneliness are
              significant concerns for elderly residents, contributing to
              depression, cognitive decline, and reduced quality of life.
